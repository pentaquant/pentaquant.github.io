  <h1><strong>Mean Variance Optimization</strong></h1>
    <div>
      <h2>An Introduction</h2>
      <p>Mean variance optimization (MVO) is a quantitative method in modern portfolio theory used for asset allocation. Developed by Nobel Laureate Harry Markovitz in 1951, MVO looks to output an optimal asset allocation for a portfolio of at least two different assets or assets classes.</p>

      <h3><strong>Inputs</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li><em>Expected Return (e):</em> the expected return of each asset</li>
          <li><em>Standard Deviation (x):</em>the standard deviation, a measure of risk, for each asset</li>
          <li><em>Correlation Matrix:</em> describes how closely the returns of the assets in a portfolio are correlated</li>
        </ol>

      <h3><strong>An Example</strong></h3>
        <p>Below is an example of MVO in a two asset portfolio over a single period of time. The inputs in the example are as followed:</p>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
              <th rowspan="2">Asset</th>
              <th rowspan="2">Expected<br>Return</th>
              <th rowspan="2">Standard<br>Deviation</th>
              <th colspan="2">Correlation Matrix</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Asset 1</td>
              <td>Asset 2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Asset 1</td>
              <td>6%</td>
              <td>0%</td>
              <td>1.0</td>
              <td>-1.0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Asset 2</td>
              <td>10%</td>
              <td>15%</td>
              <td>-1.0</td>
              <td>1.0</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
